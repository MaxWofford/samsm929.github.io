            <br><h1><br>Types of abuse</h1>
            <p>Any one of the following are grounds for abusive relationships:<br>
                &ensp;&#8226; Physical abuse<br>
                &ensp;&#8226; Psychological and emotional abuse<br>
                &ensp;&#8226; Verbal abuse<br>
                &ensp;&#8226; Destruction of personal property<br>
                &ensp;&#8226; Threats, anger, and intimidation<br>
                &ensp;&#8226; Jealousy, isolation, posessiveness, and restriction of freedoms<br>
                &ensp;&#8226; Abuse of "male privilege"<br>
                &ensp;&#8226; Sexual abuse<br><br></p>
            <br><h2>Psychological and emotional abuse</h2>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Psychological and emotional abuse are when your partner causes you to diminish your view of yourself. Confidence in yourself plummets, leading to overall depression. Victims of domestic violence are at a higher risk for developing addictions to alcohol, tobacco, or drugs due to this. Being constantly put down about oneself is not healthy and abusive.</p>
                <img src="psychological abuse.jpg" class="img2" style="float: right;"/>
                <p><br>Types of psychological abuse include:
                    <br><br>&ensp;&#8226; Extreme or repetitive humiliation
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Controlling what you can or cannot do
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Withholding information
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Deliberately doing something to cause diminishment or embarrassment
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Forceful isolation friends and/or family
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Denying access to money or other basic resources

                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Convincing you that you are crazy</p>
                <p><br><i>"Psychological abuse can be defined as the systematic use of malicious manipulation through nonphysical acts against an intimate partner, child, or dependent adult. Also known as emotional abuse, these actions can include threatening the physical health of the victim or the victim's loved ones, purposely controlling the victim's freedom, and/or acting to undermine or isolate the victim. Psychological abuse can occur prior to physical, sexual, or other abuses. However, it can also happen at the same time as they occur. Even when it occurs by itself, it is thought to cause long-term damage to the victim's mental health."</i></p>
                <p class="facts">The facts:
                    <br><br>&ensp;&#8226; 48.4% of women and 48.8% of men have experienced at least one psychologically aggressive behavior by an intimate partner
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; 4 in 10 women and 4 in 10 men have experienced at least one form of coercive control by an intimate partner in their lifetime
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; 17.9% of women have experienced a situation where an intimate partner tried to keep them from seeing family and friends
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; 18.7% of women have experienced threats of physical harm by an intimate partner
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; 95% of men who physically abuse their intimate partners also psychologically abuse them
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Women who earn 65% or more of their households' income are more likely to be psychologically abused than women who learn less than 65% of their households' income</p>
                <p class="recap">If your partner:
                    <br><br>&ensp;&#8226; Threatens to harm you, your children, your family and/or your pets
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Tells you are worthless and that no one else will ever love you
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Isolates you from your friends and/or family
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Controls your behavior and monitor your movements and whereabouts
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Tells you that you are crazy
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Demeans you in public or in private
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Constantly criticizes you
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Blames you for everything that goes wrong
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Stalks you
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Causes you to feel guilt over things that are not your fault
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Threatens to take away your children
                    <br><br>then you or a loved one may be a victim of psychological abuse and should end that realtionship or seek aid to do something about it. If you are worried, call the abuse hotline: 1-800-799-7233 (for TTY for Deaf/hard of hearing: 1-800-787-3224)</p>
            <br><br><br><br><br><h2>Destruction of personal property</h2>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Under some circumstances, destruction of personal property can be considered domestic violence. Destructive acts, such as this, that aren't necesarily aimed at victim can still be considered domestic violence. For example, if you were to slash your ex's tires in his or her driveway, it would be a destructive act. Though this may not result in a domestic violence criminal charge, it may result in a restraining order on the gorunds of demoestic violence. Generally, anything under the ownership of the victim, even if the ownership is "shared" (as justification), should be respected. A purposeful lack of respect for these objects, whether in anger, spite, or as a means for control/intimidation, constitutes as abusive and tramples upon your basic human rights.</p>
                <p class="facts2">The facts:
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; The cost of domestic violence exceeds $8.3 billion annually.
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Relationships are the leading cause for personal property damage
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; To put that in perspective, in 2010, there were an estimated 9,082,887 property crime offenses in the Nation. Think about how many of these instances would be due to the leading cause, relationship abuse</p>
                <p><br>Types of destruction of personal property include:
                    <br><br>&ensp;&#8226; Destroying personal effects
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Ruining belongings
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Defacing or causing damage to home or automobile
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; Taking or hiding things</p>
            <br><h2>Abuse of "male privilege"</h2>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Just as one should have control over their life, one should have control over their relationship, right? The answer to this conflicting statement is <i>no.</i> A relationship involves a mutual, equal sharing of the highs, lows, burdens, responsibilties, and happiness. If it somehow comes about that your partner is being oppressed by you in a realtionship, you are in violation of abuse. When a partner (usually a female, hence "male priviledge") has more of a burden in a relationship, they are a victim of privilege abuse.</p>
                <p class="facts">The facts:
                    <br><br>Of 1,700 junior high school students...
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; A quarter of the boys and a sixth of the girls said that a man has the right to have sex with a woman without asking, as long as he has spent money on her
                    <br>&ensp;&#8226; A majority of the boys and a near majority of the girls said that it's permissible for a man to force sex on a woman if thecouple has dated for six months</p>
                <p class="recap"><br>Types of privilege abuse include:
                <br><br>&ensp;&#8226; Not being able to make big decisions
                <br>&ensp;&#8226; Going out with friends but not allowing that to the partner
                <br>&ensp;&#8226; Walking out on an argument and leaving
                <br>&ensp;&#8226; Using the argument that doing more for the relationship equals more control over it
                <br>&ensp;&#8226; Claiming the right to more control in a relationship than the partner
                <br>&ensp;&#8226; Claiming entitlement where the victim has little to none</p>
                <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;At the end of the day, if you are being treated as less of a decision-making in your relationship and your life on the grounds of "not deserving it", you are a victim of privilege abuse. If your partner uses their gender, or anything else about themself for that matter, as a way to justify control in a relationship, you are a victim of abuse. Once again, end that realtionship or seek aid to do something about it. If you are worried, call the abuse hotline: 1-800-799-7233 (for TTY for Deaf/hard of hearing: 1-800-787-3224)</p>
